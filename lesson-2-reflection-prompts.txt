What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is the holding place for files that are deemed part of a commit. It allows
	the developer to pick and choose which of the changes she made will be part of the 
	commit, rather than require that all changes in the working dorectory be part of 
	the commit.  This allows for flexibility, especially when working on many chnages 
	concurrently, in which case, subsets of changes which logically go tother can be 
	packaged into commits.

change?
